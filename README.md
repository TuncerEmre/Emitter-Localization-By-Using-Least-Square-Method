Emitter Localization Using PDOA Model

This project focuses on one of the critical topics in electronics engineering: determining the localization of emitters. The PDOA (Phase Difference of Arrival) model is utilized to achieve accurate emitter localization. The entire project is developed and executed using MATLAB.

Overview

2D Plane Localization

In the initial phase of the project, emitter localization is analyzed on a 2D plane. The following factors are examined to determine their effect on the accuracy of localization:

Number of sensors

Distribution of sensors

Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) value

Transition to 3D Localization

Based on the findings from the 2D plane analysis, the model is adapted and extended to a 3D environment to better approximate real-life scenarios. In this context, the noise values of the sensors are determined by the user-input SNR value.

Features

2D Emitter Localization:

Analysis of the impact of sensor quantity and distribution

Examination of SNR value effects on localization accuracy

3D Emitter Localization:


Adaptation of the 2D model to a 3D environment

Realistic noise modeling based on user-defined SNR values
